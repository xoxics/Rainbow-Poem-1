I am thirsty.
You are not yourself when you are thirsty, my friend.
Purple rain
tis not pink
tis not orange either
could be Blue
or maybe Green
Indigo children
Recycle!
Unicorns exist
Yellow river
purple rain
I only wanted to see you
bathing in the purple rain!
is not sullen
is not pain
this is dark, no?
darkness is relative
is not pink
is not orange either
is not brown like a beaver
indeed sang the stupendous starfish
and swam with the turtles and whales
